== Semantic Error ==
0f. There seems to be that steps are not skipped properly when searching, leaving it to search a bit too little unpredictable.
    Observation - When pressing a tile with 0 mines as neighbours, it expands improperly:
                   - if the immediate next neighbour itself has mines as neighbours, 
                     - Then it won't display that neighbours neighbourcount
    Thoughts: I think I solved the problem, or at the very least figured out the cause.
              So I'm likely getting into a situation where it is backing towards clicked cell, 
              and when it reaches it it does not look at teh remaining neighbours  
              Imagine this; StartCell->GoLeft->GoUp->HitStop->GotBack->GoLeft->HitStop->GoBack-GoDown->

== Things left to implement ==   
1j. Add a STextComboBox or SListView to use as selection box for difficulty

1k. Register RMB in Slate, (Override OnClick functions for SButton?)
1l. Display QuestionBrush or FlagBrush when RMB is pressed (toggle)

1m. A Secret message win prompt!


    
==================== DONE ===================== (This is not representative of everything, it is mostly more important objectives)
== Errors ==
0a. Using SetText retroactively should still work as normal according to others, (Fixed, issue was order of access)
0b. Noticed that the GridData and the GridPanel buttons array is not synced in their indices.
    Same length but the iterators in the for(auto&){} was jumbling around elements, making it hard to predict.    
    Found a more fitting and more efficient solution
0c. Finish investigating the Access Violation on SpreadStep, seems to be index becomes offset and goes outside of bounds, but not sure yet.   
    (Fixed it, was stepping out of bounds in the negative direction)
0d. Infinite loop when pressing create-game button. 
    (Has to do with OnValueCommitted_Raw, seemingly reaching out of bounds)
0e. Click event being sent to both function-pointers at once, causing a hang in the editor
    Solution, either override SNumericEntryBox OnValueCommitted or use an SSlider to circumvent the issue

== Things to implement ==
1a. Store Total wins/losses in saved filed (Done but haven't been tested)
1b. Fetch Correct child-slot from SDockTab (ownership chain -> SDockTab:SWrapBox:SUniformGridPanel:Button[y][x])  
1c. Set revealed tile as clicked.
1d. Display number on button (To use when revealed tile has minimum 1 neighbour)
1e. Take input from SNumericEntryBox
1f. Add a create Game button and bind it to ResetGame()?
1g. Update board layout and reset grid after pressing create-game, using new values from OnValueCommitted_Raw bind
1h. Add A Button labeled "Restart This Game (Only once)" and bind it to a second "restart this game" function
1i. Forgot to bind the NumericEntryBox to SysManager members 

== Secret/Easter-egg things ==
2a. Secret win message is obfuscated and is read through Binder() and Flipper(), 
    which should only be called when 5 wins during one session has been achieved.    
2b. Create own decoder and ditch cppencode 
    (Already ditched cppencode, now only need to make own decoder in the dcde function, 
    this particular decoding is a simple algorithm of I think about 7 steps)
