# minesweeper_poc_editortoolsue4
Started as a test, has been further elaborated upon since on my windows machine.
(Will update the repo when I have access to my windows machine again)


Generated doxygen documentation is located at: poc-editortoolsue4/Plugins/MineSweeperEditor/Documentation/


Goals (finished)

-> Leverage ue4's SlateUI for interactive tools (editors) within the engine. 

-> Store and load session data.

-> Perfomantly handle large amounts of data and objects.

-> Keep tool data in a POD format that is seperated from the UI-objects, no need of heavy objects if avoidable. 

-> Implement simple template-based code obfuscation (To hide an easter-egg in the code, good luck finding it!)
