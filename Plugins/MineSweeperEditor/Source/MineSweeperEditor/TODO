== Semantic Error ==
0f. There seems to be that steps are not skipped properly when searching, leaving it to search a bit too little unpredictable.
    I fixed the stepping issue, partially due to a typo in SetAttributes and partially due to the order of   
    but it also seems that it steps one level of depth less than it should.  

== Things left to implement ==   
1m. Inherit from SButton, override the OnClick_ functions to read both LMB & RMB. (Inspect SButton source-file)
1n. Get resources loading properly (Brushes). And get save.dat saved/loaded properly.

    
==================== DONE ===================== (This is not representative of everything, it is mostly more important objectives)
== Errors ==
0a. Using SetText retroactively should still work as normal according to others, (Fixed, issue was order of access)
0b. Noticed that the GridData and the GridPanel buttons array is not synced in their indices.
    Same length but the iterators in the for(auto&){} was jumbling around elements, making it hard to predict.    
    Found a more fitting and more efficient solution
0c. Finish investigating the Access Violation on SpreadStep, seems to be index becomes offset and goes outside of bounds, but not sure yet.   
    (Fixed it, was stepping out of bounds in the negative direction)
0d. Infinite loop when pressing create-game button. 
    (Has to do with OnValueCommitted_Raw, seemingly reaching out of bounds)
0e. Click event being sent to both function-pointers at once, causing a hang in the editor
    Solution, either override SNumericEntryBox OnValueCommitted or use an SSlider to circumvent the issue

== Things to implement ==
1a. Store Total wins/losses in saved filed (Done but haven't been tested)
1b. Fetch Correct child-slot from SDockTab (ownership chain -> SDockTab:SWrapBox:SUniformGridPanel:Button[y][x])  
1c. Set revealed tile as clicked.
1d. Display number on button (To use when revealed tile has minimum 1 neighbour)
1e. Take input from SNumericEntryBox
1f. Add a create Game button and bind it to ResetGame()?
1g. Update board layout and reset grid after pressing create-game, using new values from OnValueCommitted_Raw bind
1h. Add A Button labeled "Restart This Game (Only once)" and bind it to a second "restart this game" function
1i. Forgot to bind the NumericEntryBox to SysManager members 
1j. A win/loss prompt! (create an STextBlock displaying either "Win", "Loss" , or displays secret message if all correct conditions are met)
1k. Total Score STextBlock
1l. Replace char* with FString in Dcde (and flipper + binder), 
    rewrite the functions a bit to accomodate Ftext, or FString at the very least
1m. Add difficulty settings available for the user

== Secret/Easter-egg things ==
2a. Secret win message is obfuscated and is read through Binder() and Flipper(), 
    which should only be called when 5 wins during one session has been achieved.    
2b. Create own decoder and ditch cppencode 
    (Already ditched cppencode, now only need to make own decoder in the dcde function, 
    this particular decoding is a simple algorithm of I think about 7 steps)
2c. Just realized I could use the ue4 decode library instea, Test that the Decoded message is decoded properly with this.
