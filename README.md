# minesweeper_poc_editortoolsue4
Started as an interview test, has been further elaborated upon since on my windows machine. 
(Will update the repo when I have access to my windows machine again)

Goals 
-> Leverage ue4's SlateUI for interactive tools (editors) within the engine. 
-> Store and load session data.
-> Keep tool data in a POD format that is seperated from the UI-objects, no need of heavy objects when we can avoid it. 
-> Implement simple template-based code obfuscation (To hide an easter-egg in the code, good luck finding it!)
