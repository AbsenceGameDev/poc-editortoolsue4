   
0b. Finish investigating the Access Violation on SpreadStep, seems to be index becomes offset and goes outside of bounds, but not sure yet.   
   
1d. Take input from SNumericEntryBox
1e. Add a STextComboBox to use as selection box for difficulty

2a. Register RMB in Slate, (Override OnClick functions for SButton?)
2b. Display QuestionBrush or FlagBrush when RMB is pressed (toggle)

3b. Create own decoder and ditch cppencode 
(Already ditched cppencode, now only need to make own decoder in the dcde function, 
this particular decoding is a simple algorithm of I think about 7 steps)
 
    
==================== DONE ===================== (This is not representative of everything, it is mostly more important objectives)
0a. Store Total wins/losses in saved filed (Done but haven't been tested)
1a. Fetch Correct child-slot from SDockTab (ownership chain -> SDockTab:SWrapBox:SUniformGridPanel:Button[y][x])  
1c. Set revealed tile as clicked.

3a. Secret win message is obfuscated and is read through Binder() and Flipper(), 
    which should only be called when 5 wins during one session has been achieved.
    
1b. Display number on button (To use when revealed tile has minimum 1 neighbour)

1e. Using SetText retroactively should still work as normal according to other, (Fixed, issue was order of access)

0a. Noticed that the GridData and the GridPanel buttons array is not synced in their indices.
    Same length but the iterators in the for(auto&){} was jumbling around elements, making it hard to predict.    
    Found a more fitting and more efficient solution
