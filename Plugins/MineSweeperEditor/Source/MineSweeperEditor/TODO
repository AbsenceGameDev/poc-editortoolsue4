== Errors ==
0d. Infinite loop when pressing create-game button. Not a crash, just an endless loop. Will debug.

== Things to implement ==   
1g. Update board layout and reset grid after committed value from numericbox to variable
1h. Add a STextComboBox or SListView to use as selection box for difficulty

1i. Register RMB in Slate, (Override OnClick functions for SButton?)
1j. Display QuestionBrush or FlagBrush when RMB is pressed (toggle)

== Secret/Easter-egg things ==
3b. Create own decoder and ditch cppencode 
(Already ditched cppencode, now only need to make own decoder in the dcde function, 
this particular decoding is a simple algorithm of I think about 7 steps)
 
    
==================== DONE ===================== (This is not representative of everything, it is mostly more important objectives)
== Errors ==
0a. Using SetText retroactively should still work as normal according to other, (Fixed, issue was order of access)
0b. Noticed that the GridData and the GridPanel buttons array is not synced in their indices.
    Same length but the iterators in the for(auto&){} was jumbling around elements, making it hard to predict.    
    Found a more fitting and more efficient solution
0c. Finish investigating the Access Violation on SpreadStep, seems to be index becomes offset and goes outside of bounds, but not sure yet.   
    (Fixed it, was stepping out of bounds in the negative direction)
0d.

== Things to implement ==
1a. Store Total wins/losses in saved filed (Done but haven't been tested)
1b. Fetch Correct child-slot from SDockTab (ownership chain -> SDockTab:SWrapBox:SUniformGridPanel:Button[y][x])  
1c. Set revealed tile as clicked.
1d. Display number on button (To use when revealed tile has minimum 1 neighbour)
1e. Take input from SNumericEntryBox
1f. Add a create Game button and bind it to ResetGame()?

== Secret/Easter-egg things ==
2a. Secret win message is obfuscated and is read through Binder() and Flipper(), 
    which should only be called when 5 wins during one session has been achieved.
