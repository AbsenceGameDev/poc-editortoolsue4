Backup repo for minesweeper for geodesic interview

I want to make noted that I have many years of programming experience in and outside of the engine, but I have not actually used the Slate framework up until now, so some of the time was spent on just getting familiar with the API. 
Also worth noting, I had no real clue of the rules of minesweeper, but I did my best implementing what seemed like a minesweeper ruleset.
