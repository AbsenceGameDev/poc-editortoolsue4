This directory contains static builds of libdrng.a for use on
Linux* platforms. They are provided for developers who do not
have access to build toolchains that support the rdrand or
rdseed instructions.

These static libraries were built on Ubuntu 14.10 but should
work on any iA-based Linux system based on the 3.x kernel.
